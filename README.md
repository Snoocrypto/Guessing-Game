# Guessing-Game
A small word or number guessing game

This project is a guessing game developed using python. 
The user has the choice to either guess a number or a word. 
Depending on his preference, the computer will generate a random  number  with  a  selected number  of  digits or  a  random  word  from  a  selected category.  
The  number  game  has  unlimited  attempts while the  word  game  limits  the number  of  guesses  to three  times the length  of  the  secret  word.  
In  both  games,  the program will provide feedback to orientate the user's guess. 
For the number game, the computer tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low. 
For the word game, the computer informs the user if the guessed letter is inside the generated word or not. 
When the correct answer is entered, the user can choose to continue playing or to exit the game.
